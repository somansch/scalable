/**
 * Loads the Scalable card, and keeps trying until it has.
 *
 * Home Assistant puts a bare `import()` for a bundled card into the page it
 * serves - awaited by nothing, caught by nothing, and made exactly once per
 * document. Measured: one request, and navigating between dashboards never
 * makes another, because that is an in-app navigation and the document
 * stays. So a single fetch that does not arrive - Home Assistant restarting
 * in that moment, a proxy hiccup, a phone losing the network while the page
 * builds - leaves the card missing for as long as that page is open,
 * however healthy the server gets a second later. Only a reload cures it,
 * which is exactly what people report.
 *
 * This file is therefore what Home Assistant imports, and it is the one
 * that fetches the card. Being a few hundred bytes is the whole point: its
 * own fetch is about as likely to fail as anything on the network can be,
 * and from here the real module can be asked for again as often as it takes.
 *
 * Every attempt needs a URL of its own. A dynamic import that failed is
 * remembered per URL: measured, a second import of the same specifier -
 * after the file was back and answering 200 - failed again without sending
 * a single request. Hence the "retry" parameter, which changes nothing
 * about which file is served and everything about whether the browser is
 * willing to go and ask for it.
 *
 * Nothing needs reloading once an attempt gets through. Home Assistant
 * watches for the element being defined and rebuilds the card where it had
 * shown "custom element doesn't exist" - measured: one error card became
 * one real card, with no reload.
