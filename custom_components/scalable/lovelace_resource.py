"""The card in the dashboards' own resource list.

A second way in, and not an alternative to the first one.

The extra module URL (see bundle.py) reaches every page Home Assistant serves
*after* this integration was set up. A dashboard opened in the seconds while
Home Assistant is still starting is served without it - and that page then
shows "Configuration error" where the card belongs until it is reloaded. It is
the one failure the card loader cannot heal, because the loader is what never
arrived.

A Lovelace resource is read by the frontend after it has connected, out of the
dashboards' own store, so it does not depend on this integration having
finished setting up by the time the page was served.

The URL registered here is character for character the one handed to
add_extra_js_url. A browser keys its module map on the resolved URL, so the two
ways in are one request and one execution - not a second copy of the card. The
card guards its own customElements.define regardless, because the two can
resolve differently: the resource URL is resolved against the address the
browser's token was issued for, which is not always the one the page came from.

Only the storage-mode list is written to. In YAML mode the resources are a
block in the user's own configuration.yaml, which is theirs to keep, and such
an installation is left with the extra module URL exactly as before.
